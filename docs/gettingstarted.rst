Getting Started
===============

Try WebPPL
----------

The quickest way to get started using WebPPL is by running programs
using the code box on `webppl.org <http://webppl.org/>`_. WebPPL can
also be :ref:`installed locally <installation>` and run from the
command line.

Learning
--------

If you're new to probabilistic programming, `Probabilistic Models of
Cognition <https://probmods.org/>`_ is a great place to start learning
the paradigm. It uses `Church
<http://projects.csail.mit.edu/church/wiki/Church>`_ for
demonstrations, but the principles will apply when you are using
WebPPL.

The best guide to using WebPPL is `The Design and Implementation of
Probabilistic Programming Languages
<http://dippl.org/chapters/02-webppl.html>`_. The `examples
<https://github.com/probmods/webppl/tree/master/examples>`_ will also
be helpful in learning the syntax.
